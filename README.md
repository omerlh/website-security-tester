# Website Security Tester
A small script that you can use to test your site.
The first iteration check for 2 things:
 - Security Headers, using this [amazing](https://github.com/koenbuyens/securityheaders) project. Check it out, you can find so many information on each one of the headers.
 - [Security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/)

 This is just the first version, I want to extend it in the future to run more test - for example, using Zap or Snyk, or maybe even static analysis.
